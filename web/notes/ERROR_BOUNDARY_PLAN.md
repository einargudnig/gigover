# Error Boundary Implementation Plan

This document outlines a strategic approach to implementing error boundaries throughout the Gigover application to enhance error handling and improve user experience when failures occur.

## 1. App-Level Error Boundary

- [x] Replace existing ErrorBoundary in App.tsx with EnhancedErrorBoundary
- [x] Configure appropriate error categories for app-level errors
- [x] Add retry capabilities for app-level recovery
- [x] Ensure proper Sentry integration for global error tracking

## 2. Route-Level Error Boundaries

- [x] Wrap main route groups in AuthenticatedRoutes.tsx:
    - [x] Dashboard route (/)
    - [x] Project routes (/project/\*)
    - [x] Property routes (/property/\*)
    - [x] File system routes (/files/\*)
    - [x] Procurement routes (/tender/\*)
    - [x] Settings routes (/settings/\*)
- [x] Configure fallbacks appropriate for each route section
- [x] Add retry navigation options in fallback UIs

## 3. Feature-Level Error Boundaries

- [x] Identify and wrap critical feature components:
    - [x] Lazy-loaded components
    - [x] Components with complex state management
    - [x] Modal components
    - [x] Form submission components
- [x] Create specialized error boundaries for each feature area
- [x] Implement appropriate error categories for better reporting

## 4. Data Fetching Error Boundaries

- [x] Create a specialized error boundary for data fetching:
    - [x] Components using useQuery/useMutation hooks
    - [x] API service calls
    - [x] Data visualization components
- [x] Implement retry capabilities for network-related errors
- [x] Add loading/error states for query components
- [x] Configure appropriate error messages for data failures

## 5. Third-Party Integration Error Boundaries

- [ ] Add boundaries around external integrations:
    - [ ] Firebase authentication components
    - [ ] PDF rendering components (react-pdf)
    - [ ] File upload/download functionality
    - [ ] Intercom integration points
- [ ] Create fallbacks specific to third-party failures
- [ ] Add detailed error reporting for external service issues

## Implementation Approach

- [x] Create utility HOCs using `withErrorBoundary` for easy implementation
- [x] Define error categories in a central location
- [x] Establish consistent fallback UI components
- [x] Create a testing plan to verify error boundary effectiveness
- [x] Document error boundary strategy for team reference
- [ ] Monitor error rates in Sentry after implementation
