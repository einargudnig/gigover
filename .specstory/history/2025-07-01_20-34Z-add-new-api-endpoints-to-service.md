# Add new API endpoints to service (2025-07-01 20:34Z)

_**User**_

You add to the api servers.ts file three APIs, one that is believe organization, one that is delete organization. Those two should be located at a similar place where the organization APIs and then another one is delete property. To start with you can just make them the same as the closest one. You can just say whatever.

---

_**Assistant**_

OBSERVATIONS:
- You want to add three new API endpoints to your `ApiService` (which you referred to as "api servers.ts", but the actual file is `ApiService.ts`).
- The three endpoints are:
  1. "believe organization" (likely a typo, possibly "delete organization" or "leave organization"?)
  2. "delete organization"
  3. "delete property"
- You want these to be placed near similar endpoints in the file, and for now, they can just mimic the closest existing ones.

REASONING:
- The organization-related endpoints are grouped under the "Organization" section.
- The property-related endpoints are under the "Properties" section.
- For "delete organization", there is no direct endpoint, but similar ones like `removeInviteToOrganization` and `changeOrganizations` exist.
- For "delete property", there is `removePropertyDocument`, but not a direct property delete.
- "believe organization" is unclear, but if it's a typo for "leave organization", it would be similar to "rejectOrganizationInvite" or "removeInviteToOrganization".

PLAN:
1. Add a `deleteOrganization` endpoint in the Organization section, mimicking the style of other endpoints.
2. Add a `leaveOrganization` (assuming "believe" is "leave") endpoint in the Organization section, mimicking similar endpoints.
3. Add a `deleteProperty` endpoint in the Properties section, mimicking the style of other endpoints.
4. For now, just use placeholder URLs similar to the closest endpoints, as requested.

I will now make these additions to `web/src/services/ApiService.ts`.

```diff
  	static removePropertyDocument = (documentId: number) =>
  		API_BASE + 'properties/removeDocument/' + documentId;
+ 	static deleteProperty = (propertyId: number) =>
+ 		API_BASE + 'properties/deleteProperty/' + propertyId;
  
  	// Organization
```

```diff
  	// org login?
  	static loginOrganization = API_BASE + 'org/login';
+ 	static deleteOrganization = (organizationId: number) =>
+ 		API_BASE + 'user/orgDelete/' + organizationId;
+ 	static leaveOrganization = (organizationId: number) =>
+ 		API_BASE + 'user/orgLeave/' + organizationId;
  }
  
```

I've added the following three API endpoints to `ApiService.ts`:

1. **deleteOrganization**:  
   ```ts
   static deleteOrganization = (organizationId: number) =>
       API_BASE + 'user/orgDelete/' + organizationId;
   ```
   - Placed in the Organization section, mimicking the style of similar endpoints.

2. **leaveOrganization** (assuming "believe" was a typo for "leave"):  
   ```ts
   static leaveOrganization = (organizationId: number) =>
       API_BASE + 'user/orgLeave/' + organizationId;
   ```
   - Also in the Organization section, next to other organization-related actions.

3. **deleteProperty**:  
   ```ts
   static deleteProperty = (propertyId: number) =>
       API_BASE + 'properties/deleteProperty/' + propertyId;
   ```
   - Placed in the Properties section, following the pattern of other property endpoints.

These are currently using placeholder URLs that follow the conventions of the closest existing endpoints, as requested.

If you need to adjust the endpoint URLs or want to clarify the "believe organization" action, let me know!
