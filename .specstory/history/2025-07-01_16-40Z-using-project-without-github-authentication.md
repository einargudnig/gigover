# Using project without GitHub authentication (2025-07-01 16:40Z)

_**User**_

Is there a way for me to use this without authenticationg to the github?

_**Assistant**_

**Observations:**
- You have a setup script (`web/setup.sh`) for your `web` project that installs dependencies, builds the project, and optionally starts the dev server.
- You are asking if you can use "this" (likely the project or the setup script) without authenticating to GitHub.

**Reasoning:**
- Most Node.js/React/Next.js projects (like your `web` directory) do not require GitHub authentication to run locally, unless:
  - The dependencies in `package.json` reference private GitHub repositories.
  - The build or runtime process fetches code or assets from private GitHub repos.
  - There are custom scripts that require GitHub API access.
- The provided `setup.sh` script only uses `npm` commands (`npm ci`, `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm start`), which do not require GitHub authentication for public packages.
- If you cloned the repository from GitHub, you only need authentication for private repos or to push changes, not to run the code.

**Plan:**
1. Confirm that all dependencies in `web/package.json` are public (no private GitHub URLs).
2. Confirm that the build and start scripts do not require GitHub authentication.
3. Summarize when GitHub authentication is needed and when it is not.

**Conclusion:**
- **You do NOT need to authenticate to GitHub to use the setup script or run the project locally, as long as:**
  - All dependencies are public (from npm or public GitHub repos).
  - You are not trying to push code or access private resources.
- **You only need GitHub authentication if:**
  - You want to clone a private repo.
  - You want to push changes to GitHub.
  - The project fetches private code/assets from GitHub during build or runtime.

**Action for you:**
- Just run `sh setup.sh` in the `web` directory. If you hit an error about a missing private dependency, then authentication would be required, but for most standard setups, it is not.

If you want me to check your `package.json` for private dependencies, let me know!
