  Use this agent when you need to integrate Sentry for error monitoring and
  tracking in your application. Examples: <example>Context: User wants to add
  error tracking to their React application. user: 'I need to add error
  monitoring to my React app so I can track crashes in production' assistant:
  'I'll use the sentry-setup-specialist agent to help you integrate Sentry for
  comprehensive error tracking in your React application'</example>
  <example>Context: User is experiencing unhandled errors in production and
  needs monitoring. user: 'My Node.js API keeps crashing in production and I
  have no visibility into what's causing it' assistant: 'Let me use the
  sentry-setup-specialist agent to set up Sentry error monitoring so you can
  track and debug these production issues effectively'</example>
  <example>Context: User wants to proactively add error tracking before
  deployment. user: 'Before I deploy my app, I want to make sure I have proper
  error tracking in place' assistant: 'I'll use the sentry-setup-specialist
  agent to implement Sentry error monitoring before your deployment to ensure
  you have full visibility into any issues'</example>

These examples should be used as guidance when configuring Sentry functionality within a project.

# Error / Exception Tracking

Use `Sentry.captureException(error)` to capture an exception and log the error in Sentry.
Use this in try catch blocks or areas where exceptions are expected

# Tracing Examples

Spans should be created for meaningful actions within an applications like button clicks, API calls, and function calls
Ensure you are creating custom spans with meaningful names and operations
Use the `Sentry.startSpan` function to create a span
Child spans can exist within a parent span

## Custom Span instrumentation in component actions

```javascript
function TestComponent() {
  const handleTestButtonClick = () => {
    // Create a transaction/span to measure performance
    Sentry.startSpan(
      {
        op: "ui.click",
        name: "Test Button Click",
      },
      (span) => {
        const value = "some config";
        const metric = "some metric";

        // Metrics can be added to the span
        span.setAttribute("config", value);
        span.setAttribute("metric", metric);

        doSomething();
      },
    );
  };

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={handleTestButtonClick}>
      Test Sentry
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Custom span instrumentation in API calls

```javascript
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  return Sentry.startSpan(
    {
      op: "http.client",
      name: `GET /api/users/${userId}`,
    },
    async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      return data;
    },
  );
}
```

# Logs

Where logs are used, ensure Sentry is imported using `import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react"`
Enable logging in Sentry using `Sentry.init({ enableLogs: true })`
Reference the logger using `const { logger } = Sentry`
Sentry offers a consoleLoggingIntegration that can be used to log specific console error types automatically without instrumenting the individual logger calls

## Configuration

### Baseline

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",

  enableLogs: true,
});
```

### Logger Integration

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",
  integrations: [
    // send console.log, console.error, and console.warn calls as logs to Sentry
    Sentry.consoleLoggingIntegration({ levels: ["log", "error", "warn"] }),
  ],
});
```

## Logger Examples

`logger.fmt` is a template literal function that should be used to bring variables into the structured logs.

```javascript
logger.trace("Starting database connection", { database: "users" });
logger.debug(logger.fmt`Cache miss for user: ${userId}`);
logger.info("Updated profile", { profileId: 345 });
logger.warn("Rate limit reached for endpoint", {
  endpoint: "/api/results/",
  isEnterprise: false,
});
logger.error("Failed to process payment", {
  orderId: "order_123",
  amount: 99.99,
});
logger.fatal("Database connection pool exhausted", {
  database: "users",
  activeConnections: 100,
});
```
